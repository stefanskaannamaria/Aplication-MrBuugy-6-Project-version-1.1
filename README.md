# Project description 

Application MrBuggy6 is a tool for managers of the company providing testing services. This piece of software should allow Managers to keep a track of bidding process for new testing projects (called opportunities), maintain current testing projects (called projects), with access to the list of human resources (employees), clients and services provided by the company. This is the first version delivered by developers to tests so it is expected to contains some defects.

Mr Buggy 6 is a application which was shared for the purpose of testing education. It was served as tasks during TestingCup - Championship 2018  in Software Testing.

# The basic components of the Mr Buggy6 application

Folders based on Stories and requirements:

- Creating password of user
- Logging in application
- Editing profile of user
- Opportunity
- Clients
- Employess
- Projects
- Services

Because of  the time constraint, the author of the project decided to test the test cases from the modules: Creating password of user, Logging in application and Editing profile of user. 
These modules was seemed to be the most important in author’s opinion. This decision was based tester’s experience and experience of working with similar application.

# Technologies

- Testrail (It was used during creating test cases, test runs and summary reports)
- Jira (It was used during creating user stories and reporting bugs)
- Microsoft PowerPoint (It was used during creating summary presentation about project)
- Microsoft Word( It was used during creating Test Plan, Final Summary Report and Functional specification of the application MrBuggy6)

# Environment

Lenovo T510, Windows Home 10 version 21H2

# Installation 

The application was dowloaded from website www.mrbugggy.pl.

# Action plan

1) The first task was analysis of requirements and creation of test cases based on the requirements using TestRail. 
2) The author of project made an exploratory session in which resulted was discovered two bugs which subjected to further analysis.
3) I created Test Cases which were classified in folders and subfolders (based on requirements)
4) I executed the part of test cases and I set up the status per step (passed / failed). The bugs encountered were linked to the test cases and I established the severity for each one. 
5) The next I configurate tools Jira and Testrail. I reported bugs in Jira. I added outcomes: test executions, screenshots and comments.

# Conclusions for future projects

In the future I would like to test other modules and verify the operation of the system. Additionally I would like to compares any others components for bugs.
In the end I am going to execute tests of system and  tests of acceptance
